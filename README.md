# hyperliquid-openapi-schema

OpenAPI Schema for Hyperliquid API

The goal/purpose of this schema is to act as a reference for Hyperliquid developers

To be use to validate against their sdk implementations

Ideally it can be use for sdk generations using codegen. (Currently the schema is written in a way where it eases comparison/reference but not a valid OpenAPI schema for swagger or codegen yet)

## Roadmap

[ ] Cleanup to be valid OpenAPI schema

[ ] Create a Swagger UI

[ ] Update missing schemas
